# Island.is login

Library to make it easier to handle logging in with island.is

To get started with Island.is Identification and Authentication Services (IAS) you'll need to apply: vefur.island.is/innskraningarthjonusta/um/.


## How it works

The token the √çsland.is IAS returns to the service provider(you), for decoding by the service provider, is a digitally signed SAML 2 token encoded in Base 64 and UTF-8.

The SAML message returned by IAS will be digitally signed with a certificate issued by Traustur bunadur. Furthermore, the message will have been transformed with xml-exc-c14n, prior to being digested with SHA256 and signed with a 2048-bit RSA key.

This library helps with validating and verifying the SAML token, and the provided signature.
